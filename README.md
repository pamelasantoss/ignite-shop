### :bulb: Description

Simple ecommerce application built in TypeScript and Next.
In this application, you'll see a mini t-shirts store where you'll be able to buy them as much as you like, but don't worry, you are **NOT** going to buy them for real. This is just a sample for what I learned about Stripe API and working with API route in Next.

I also implemented the mini cart functionality using the library `useShoppingCart`, so the information is updated while you shopping! This application was a part of a Rocketseat course for practice everything I learned.
